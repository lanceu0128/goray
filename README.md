A simple raytracer (and cel shader) implemented in Go! Using this project to learn about computer graphics, linear algebra, the Go language, and concurrency. Currently features simple raytracing (lights, shadows, reflections, etc.) and cel shading (color quantization and edge detection). 

Example output image, with cel shading:
